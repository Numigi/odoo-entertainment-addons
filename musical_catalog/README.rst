By clicking on a create button you can create a new language.

Module Design
-------------
The module ``musical_catalog`` does not depend on the module ``recording``.
The dependency goes the other way.

The menu item to configure catalogs is added by the module ``recording``.

This allows to use musical catalogs for other purposes without depending on the ``Recording`` app.
