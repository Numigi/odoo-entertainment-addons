Configuration
-------------

Journal Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under ``Recording / Mapping / Journals``, I find the mapping table used to identify which
accounting journal to use when posting revenues.

It allows to define one journal per currency and company.

Usage
-----
In the ``Recording`` application, I find a new menu entry ``Generate Journal Entries``.

After clicking on the button, one job is created for each revenue of the current company.

Once the jobs have passed, I find a new journal entry for each revenue.

How Does It Work
----------------

Fiscal Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 2 options for identifying the fiscal position of a revenue line.

* Partner: based on the partner defined on the revenue.
* Revenue: based on the country and state defined on the revenue itself.

When posting a revenue, the fiscal position is used to map the taxes and the revenue account.
This works the same way as for a customer invoice.

If the fiscal position is not found for a given revenue, the job will fail with a detailed error message.

Payment Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sales payment terms of the partner are used to determinate the due date.

The ``Period End Date`` defined on the revenue is used as date of reference
to compute the due date.

If a partner has no sales payment term, the ``Period End Date`` is used as due date.

Currencies
~~~~~~~~~~
The ``Date of Operation`` defined on the revenue is used to determine the currency rate to apply in the journal entry.

Other Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deprecated Account
******************
If a journal account used for posting a revenue is deprecated, the job will fail with a detailed error message.

Recording Status
****************
If the recording is not validated, the job will fail with an error message.
